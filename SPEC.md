# Specification for RPG
### Based on polls

We are making a fast-paced multiplayer action game similar to Crawl (so a dungeon crawler). We have not yet decided on a stat system yet. 

For those who don't know, Crawl is a dungeon crawler where one player playes a human, and the other players are the monsters. When a monster kills the human, that player switches and becomes the human. The goal is to kill the "boss monster."

We will be using GitHub issues for feature/bug tracking (I don't want to pay for Asana).
